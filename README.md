# 🌟  POTD: Daily Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This repository serves as a dedicated log for the **Problem of the Day (POTD)** questions provided by my senior. It is a commitment to consistent practice in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and **Competitive Programming (CP)**, which has been invaluable for skill development.

All solutions are diligently organized by the day they were solved, keeping track of the learning journey.

## ✨ About This Repository

## 📁 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized into folders named sequentially by the day of practice: `DAY_1`, `DAY_2`, `DAY_3`, and so on.

* Each `DAY_X` folder contains the solution file (e.g., `Solution.java`) and should ideally contain the problem statement or a brief note on the problem.
